Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router Project

## Changes Made:

### 1. Installed @vercel/analytics package
- Used npm to install @vercel/analytics (version 2.0.3)
- Updated package.json with the new dependency
- Updated package-lock.json with dependency resolution

### 2. Modified src/app/layout.tsx
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the closing `</Providers>` tag
- Preserved all existing code structure and formatting

## Implementation Details:

This is an App Router project (using src/app directory structure), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file at `src/app/layout.tsx`.

The `<Analytics />` component was placed at the end of the body tag, which is the recommended placement to ensure it doesn't interfere with page rendering while still tracking all page views and interactions.

## Testing:

- ✅ Linter ran successfully - no new errors introduced by the Analytics integration
- ✅ Code compiles correctly (TypeScript checks pass)
- ⚠️  Full build encountered pre-existing environment variable errors unrelated to Analytics
- ℹ️  No test script is defined in package.json

## Files Changed:

1. `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
2. `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency resolution
3. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component

## Notes:

- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and Web Vitals
- Analytics data will be visible in the Vercel dashboard once the app is deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is required for basic analytics tracking
- The implementation follows Vercel's official documentation for Next.js App Router
